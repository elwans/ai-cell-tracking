It uses the transformer-based architecture developed by Benjamin Galluser and Martin Weigert [(GitHub)](https://github.com/weigertlab/trackastra).\n","This iteration trains a trackastra model on a provided Cell Tracking Challenge data set. The model can either be trained upon a previous trackastra model or train a new model from scratch.\n","\n","This framework is designed for 2D+Time datasets sourced from the [Cell Tracking Challenge website](https://celltrackingchallenge.net/2d-datasets/).\n","\n","Before use, ensure that Google Colab's runtime is set to T4 GPU-accelerated.
